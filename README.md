## FAQ

### What does this mod do?
This mod exposes new tools for modders to use by editing Civ VI's base code.

### How does this mod edit the base code?
In essence, the game will load a custom DLL, which then in turn loads the GameCore DLL and makes changes to it. If you want to learn more, join the [Civilization VI Modding Helpline](https://discord.gg/jSVhyBYvZR) and ask me there. (My username is wildw)

### Can you implement X feature?
Probably. Open a feature request on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Wild-W/CivilizationVI_CommunityExtension/issues). The more precise you are with your request the more likely I'll be able to implement it.

### Is this mod compatible with Mac/Linux?
No. It's possible to port parts of it, but it's just too far out of scope right now.

### Can you fix the asset limit bug?
Probably not.
